# Quantum-Mechanics

We put lecture notes and solutions of homework of Prof. Yiheng Lin's quantum mechanics course here. 

## GitHub tutorial

If you still don't know what is GitHub, or how to use it, I strongly recommend [Xiaolai's self-teaching Repo](https://github.com/selfteaching/the-craft-of-selfteaching/) for you. I refered to that book in the following tutorial.

For more details about GitHub, here are some other resources:
> 1. [GitHub help](https://help.github.com/en#dotcom)
> 2. [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com)
> 3. The official GitHub Desktop [documentation](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop)
> 4. [Git教程](https://www.liaoxuefeng.com/wiki/0013739516305929606dd18361248578c67b8067c8c017b000) by 廖雪峰


If you just want to download the documents(or folders) in this Repo, a simple way is to do the following steps below:
> 1. copy the url of the document(or folder) you want
> 2. paste it on [DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home), and click to download

If you want to make some contribution(which I strongly recommend) but you don't like the terminal, you can do the following steps:
> 1. create your own [github](https://github.com) account, and log in
> 2. open [this repo](https://github.com/YQChen-QI/Quantum-Mechanics) in a browser
> 3. find the `Fork` button on the top right corner of the webpage, and fork this repository to your own account
> 4. go to [Desktop for GitHub](https://desktop.github.com) and download the GUI version of git, then install it on your computer
> 5. you can find a `clone or download` button on this webpage(it should be in your own account), you should clone the repo to your own computer by the Desktop for GitHub you've just installed
> 6. when it finish downloading, you should create a new branch, switch to the new branch, then you can add your own documents(or do whatever you want)

If you want to add your own documents to this Repo, you should send me a pull request, you can see more details [here](https://github.com/YQChen-QI/Quantum-Mechanics/blob/master/Markdown/GitHub%20tutorial%20more.md).
